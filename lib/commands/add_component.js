// Library for component functions (adding, removing, ...?)
// Could use git archive command - this shouldn't require a git repository active
// But it has the downside of not being node-native (thus will require a child process)

// Alternatively, use the GitHub API and a whole lot of recursion to peek at the
// folders and download the raw text into each directory

// This has the downside of limiting component repos to those on GitHub
