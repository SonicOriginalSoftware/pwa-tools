# PWA Framework

# What is this?

This package is a toolkit to build single-page progressive web applications.

# Another framework?

No. And yes. This framework tries to sift down the boilerplate and dependency hell by being (almost) fully self-contained. Its not "another javascript front-end framework"; this actually builds forward-looking progressive web apps.

# NIH syndrome, much?

Its javascript. At some point, developers need to drop the idea of replacing one-liners with libraries and just write the code themselves.

# What system dependencies does this require?

Only a recent version of `npm`/`npx` (`13.5`+, ideally `14.0`+).

# What package dependencies does this require?

Only an unzipper library written by this same author (which in turn uses no dependencies).

# Fine. How do I use it?
