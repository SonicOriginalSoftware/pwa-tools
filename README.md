# PWA Framework

# What is this?

This package is meant as a library and toolkit to build single-page progressive web applications.

# Another framework?

No. And yes. This framework tries to sift down the boilerplate and dependency hell by being fully self-contained. Its not "another javascript front-end framework"; this actually builds forward-looking progressive web apps.

# NIH syndrome, much?

Its javascript. If its more complicated than what can be done in the source files contained in this framework then it doesn't belong here. This framework strives for elegance, simplicity, and robustness while creating web applications that are more easily pivoted to the ever-changing landscape of the web.

# BuT LeGaCy WeB ApPs ArE sTaBlE

Sure, so is IE11.

# What dependencies does this require?

Only a recent version of `npm`/`npx` (`13.5`+, ideally `14.0`+)

# Fine. How do I use it?
