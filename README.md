# PWA Framework

# What is this?

This package is meant as a library and toolkit to build single-page progressive web applications.

# Another framework?

No. And yes. This framework tries to sift down the boilerplate and dependency hell by being (almost) fully self-contained. Its not "another javascript front-end framework"; this actually builds forward-looking progressive web apps.

# But what about the unzipper?

Yes! The unzipper I wrote from scratch and submitted back to the community to do with what they see fit. "Why didn't you just use an existing library!?!?!?!" Well, because the ones that are popular are abandoned and the ones that aren't abandoned I don't like! Simple as that!

# NIH syndrome, much?

Its javascript. If its more complicated than what can be done in the source files contained in this framework then it doesn't belong here. This framework strives for elegance, simplicity, and robustness while creating web applications that are more easily pivoted to the ever-changing landscape of the web. At some point, developers need to drop the ideas of replacing one-liners with libraries and just write the code themselves.

Sure, so is IE11.

# What dependencies does this require?

Only a recent version of `npm`/`npx` (`13.5`+, ideally `14.0`+) and `git`

# Fine. How do I use it?
